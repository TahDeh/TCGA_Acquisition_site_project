Codes and files related to the [Biased Data, Biased Data"](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-943804/v1) paper.

The excel file (tissue__source_site_data.xslx) contains information of the tissue acquisition sites of 8927 WSIs. 

Additional info on patch selection and feature extraction is provided at [KimiaLab's Website](https://kimialab.uwaterloo.ca/kimia/index.php/data-and-code-2/kimia-net/).

Since deep feature extraction is a time consuming process, extracted DenseNet and KimiaNet deep features are provided in pickle files.
